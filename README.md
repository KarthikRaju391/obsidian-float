## Obsidian Float
This is a plugin for Obsidian which enhances the current highlight feature of Obsidian by adding better animations to focus more on the highlights as you scroll down while in reading mode.

`Note`: On highlighting a single word, the whole text block containing the highlighted word will be animated too.
