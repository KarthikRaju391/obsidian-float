## Obsidian Float
This is a plugin for Obsidian which enhances the current highlight feature of Obsidian by adding better animations to focus more on the highlights as you scroll down while in reading mode.

## Usage

1. Use Obsidian's built-in highlight syntax to mark text: `==your highlighted text==`
2. Switch to **Reading mode** (the plugin does not work in Live Preview or Source mode)
3. Scroll through your note — highlighted blocks will animate into focus as they enter the viewport

`Note`: The entire text block (paragraph, list item, heading, etc.) containing the highlighted word will be animated, not just the highlighted word itself.
